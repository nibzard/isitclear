# Research Findings: IsItClear Chrome Extension

## Overview
Research completed for Chrome extension using Gemini Nano AI APIs to improve text clarity across any website input field.

## Chrome AI APIs Analysis

### Decision: Primary API - Chrome Rewriter API
**Rationale**: The Rewriter API is purpose-built for text improvement and clarity enhancement, which directly matches IsItClear's core functionality. It provides structured parameters for tone and length control.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Prompt API: More flexible but requires custom prompting for clarity-specific tasks
- Writer API: Designed for content creation rather than improvement
- Combined approach: Rewriter as primary + Prompt API as fallback

### Decision: Chrome Extension Manifest V3
**Rationale**: Required for modern Chrome extensions, provides necessary security model and API access for Chrome AI features.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manifest V2: Deprecated and won't support new AI APIs
- Web application: Cannot access local AI models in same way

### Decision: Local-First Processing
**Rationale**: Chrome's Gemini Nano runs locally, providing privacy, speed, and offline capability - core benefits for text processing extension.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cloud APIs (OpenAI, etc.): Privacy concerns, latency, cost, internet dependency
- Hybrid approach: Unnecessary complexity given local AI capabilities

## Browser Compatibility & Requirements

### Decision: Chrome 138+ Target
**Rationale**: Chrome 138 provides stable Prompt API access for extensions, Rewriter API available in origin trial from 137+.

**Hardware Requirements Confirmed**:
- 22 GB storage for initial model download
- 4+ GB VRAM for optimal performance
- Windows 10/11, macOS 13+, Linux, ChromeOS (Chromebook Plus)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Earlier Chrome versions: APIs not available
- Cross-browser support: No equivalent local AI in other browsers

## Input Field Detection Strategy

### Decision: DOM Event-Based Detection
**Rationale**: Use focus events to identify text input elements (input[type="text"], textarea, contenteditable) across all websites.

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('focusin', (e) => {
  if (e.target.matches('input[type="text"], textarea, [contenteditable]')) {
    initializeClarityHelper(e.target);
  }
});
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- MutationObserver: More complex, higher performance overhead
- Periodic scanning: Less efficient, poor user experience
- Manual activation only: Reduces ease of use

## User Experience Strategy

### Decision: Contextual Overlay UI
**Rationale**: Show clarity improvement UI near the focused input field to maintain context and minimize disruption.

**Activation Method**: 
- Automatic appearance on text input focus (when text present)
- Keyboard shortcut for explicit activation
- Right-click context menu as secondary option

**Alternatives considered**:
- Browser action popup: Disconnected from content context
- Side panel: Takes focus away from writing
- Inline replacement: Too disruptive to writing flow

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Session Reuse Pattern
**Rationale**: Create AI sessions once and reuse them to avoid initialization overhead for each text analysis.

**Memory Management**: Destroy sessions when user navigates away or extension becomes inactive.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Session per request: High overhead, slower response times
- Global persistent session: Memory leak risks, stale state issues

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Multi-Layer Testing Approach
**Rationale**: Chrome extensions require specialized testing for both extension APIs and DOM interaction.

**Testing Layers Confirmed**:
1. **Contract Tests**: Chrome API availability and response formats
2. **Integration Tests**: Extension + webpage interaction scenarios
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows across different websites
4. **Unit Tests**: Individual library functions

**Test Environment**: Jest + Chrome extension testing utilities + real Chrome instance for API testing

**Alternatives considered**:
- Mock Chrome APIs: Cannot test actual AI behavior
- Manual testing only: Not repeatable, no regression protection

## Security & Privacy

### Decision: Content Script Isolation
**Rationale**: Use content script boundaries to protect user data and prevent conflicts with website JavaScript.

**Privacy Approach**: All processing local (Gemini Nano), no data transmission, minimal storage of user preferences only.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Injected scripts: Security risks, potential conflicts
- Cloud processing: Privacy concerns, data transmission

## Technology Stack Finalization

**Languages**: JavaScript ES2022, HTML5, CSS3
**Primary APIs**: Chrome Rewriter API, Chrome Prompt API (fallback), Chrome Extensions API
**Testing**: Jest + Chrome extension testing framework
**Build Tools**: Standard web technologies (no complex build pipeline needed)
**Storage**: Chrome extension local storage for minimal user preferences

## Implementation Readiness

All research questions resolved. No blocking unknowns identified. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 (Design & Contracts).

**Key Technical Constraints Confirmed**:
- Chrome 138+ requirement is acceptable for target audience
- 22GB model download is one-time user cost
- Local processing limitations are within acceptable bounds for text clarity use case
- No server infrastructure required
