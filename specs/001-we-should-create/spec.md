# Feature Specification: IsItClear Chrome Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-should-create`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We should create a Chrome web extension that would use built-in Gemini models. So currently, with the latest version, there is AI with Chrome. If you go to developer.chrome.com.au, you could find the new APIs like Writer API, Rewriter API, Prompt API. So fetch that to understand that there is a Gemini Nano that is packed now with Google Chrome browser. So we should build an extension that is called IsItClear, which will essentially just have a prompt for an LLM that is inside Chrome. And the only thing it will do, it will basically send your writing that you wrote in any input field inside any website and ask an LLM, IsItClear? And then it will rewrite the text with a better rewritten for clarity text. So essentially a Chrome extension that elegantly without, with great user experience and without any friction, works in any input or text field in any website. And use this on your device, local first Gemini Nano that comes now with new Chrome. And just rewrite the text."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Clear feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Identified text clarity improvement in any input field
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è  MARKED: Several clarification needs identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Clear user flow determined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Text content and clarity improvements identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARN: Spec has some uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user is writing text in any input field on any website (email compose, social media post, form field, comment box, etc.) and wants to improve the clarity of their writing. They activate the IsItClear extension, which analyzes their text and provides a clearer, rewritten version that they can choose to replace their original text with.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has typed text in an email compose field, **When** they activate the IsItClear extension, **Then** the extension analyzes the text and presents a clearer rewritten version
2. **Given** a user has written a social media post, **When** they use IsItClear to improve clarity, **Then** they receive an improved version and can choose to replace their original text
3. **Given** a user is filling out a form with a text area, **When** they request clarity improvement, **Then** the extension provides a rewritten version without disrupting the form submission flow
4. **Given** a user activates IsItClear on empty text field, **When** no text is present, **Then** the extension provides appropriate feedback indicating no text to analyze

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the text is already perfectly clear?
- How does the system handle very long text passages?
- What occurs when the local AI model is unavailable or not supported?
- How does the extension behave with rich text editors or formatted content?
- What happens with text in languages other than English?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and work with any text input field across all websites
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze existing text content for clarity improvement opportunities
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide rewritten text that improves clarity while preserving original meaning
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to easily activate the clarity check from any input field
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to accept or reject the rewritten text suggestions
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve the original text until user explicitly chooses to replace it
- **FR-007**: System MUST work offline using local browser AI capabilities
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide immediate feedback when analyzing text
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum and maximum text length limits not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST work with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific input field types - textarea, contenteditable, input text, rich text editors?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle text in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: supported languages not specified - English only or multilingual?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: activation method not specified - keyboard shortcut, right-click menu, button overlay, etc.]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Original Text**: The user's initial text content that needs clarity improvement
- **Analyzed Text**: The rewritten version provided by the AI for improved clarity  
- **Text Input Field**: Any web form element where users can enter text content
- **Clarity Improvement**: The specific changes made to enhance text readability and understanding
